# Seattle Christmas 2016 Availability
* This query, albeit off topic from my greater quest of rating listings by review quality, allowed me to have some fun with where statements
* I asked the question: Which houses in Queen Anne were available on Christmas in 2016, and had a "superhost"?
* To still draw comparisons, ["superhosts" are one of Air BnB's built-in ranking systems](https://www.airbnb.com/superhost), which is slightly more complex than the tool I built:
  * Superhosts maintain an overall rating of 4.8 or higher
  * 90% of the time, they respond to guests within 24 hours
  * They host at least 10 stays per year
  * They never cancel, unless there's an extenuating circumstance
