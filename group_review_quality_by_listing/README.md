# Grouping the Reviews for Each Listing by Quality
* Here, I joined [the table I had previously created](https://github.com/lalark/AirBNB_SQL_Project/tree/master/identify_review_quality), ranking reviews as positive, negative, or neutral, to the listing information they are associated with
* This allowed me to group reviews by listing
* I could then see which listings were broadly characterized as positive, negative, or neutral by past guests
